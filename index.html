            <h1>About Us (<span style="color: #f8dd01">Me</span>)</h1>
            <p>
              My name is Anirudh, and I am a full stack developer. I've been
              learning web development and programming for over 13 months. But
              as I was learning, I noticed such a major flaw in education about
              <span style="color: #f8dd01">Programming</span>. Many of the
              tutorials online on YouTube and Udemy, explained concepts in a way
              that made them <strong>so confusing</strong> and
              <strong>upsetting</strong> because they
              <strong>didn't make sense</strong>. And that's when I had this
              idea. You see, I naturally thought programming was hard. I
              couldn't understand <strong>anything</strong> from the online
              tutorials but, then started to understand (to a certain extent)
              <strong>everything</strong> that my family helped me with. How? I
              found out the secret is the way, you are taught it and explained!
              I realized that there are countless people who would've been in
              the same spot as me. Many of which, probably abandoned their
              programming dreams and goals(I know many people) because they
              didn't understand it. I want them to try again. I want them to
              give another chance. <strong>Why?</strong> Because this time, I
              will explain the same concepts they didn't understand earlier, in
              such a better and easier way that they never would have believed
              existed.<span style="color: #f8dd01"

              that web developers(and us) will use are based off these
              languages! So, it's crucial that you get a strong grasp and solid
              understanding of these 3 languages. That's why, the

              cool projects and applications with these languages! Some include

              We're glad you had that question! We suggest you start your
              programming journey with our
              <span style="color: #f8dd01">HTML and CSS Series</span>. HTML and
              CSS are the 2 main languages that create the dynamic webpages you
              see on the internet! In fact, I used both languages (and
              Bootstrap) to create this <strong>VERY</strong> site! After
              learning <span style="color: #f8dd01">HTML and CSS Series</span>,
              we suggest you continue by learning
              <span style="color: #f8dd01">JavaScript</span>! From there, we
              prefer you branch off and dive deeper into JavaScript by learning
              some
              <span style="color: #f8dd01">JavaScript Frameworks</span> such as
              Node JS and React JS! If you have further questions about this
              topic or doubts, please ask the DevTechJr Team on our Discord
              Server!
